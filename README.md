## Task 2
We can search for any available matric for ssl or nginx, or we can write custom matrics for this. 
Following are some importants main points to be monitored.
- As ssl offload did so much of cryptography we need to monitor memory and CPU utilization
- As the number of requests per second is very high we need to monitor read IO Statistics (kB_read/s and kB_write/s).
- Also SSL monitoring for number of requests and number of errors etc
